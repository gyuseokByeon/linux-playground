# linux-playground

Personal playground for linux related things.

Each subdirectory contains a README.md file outlining how to run the specific code.

This repo also comes with 2 vagrant VMs (Ubuntu and Centos). To get them up
```
# Ubuntu
vagrant up
vagrant ssh

# Centos
vagrant up centos
vagrant ssh
```
